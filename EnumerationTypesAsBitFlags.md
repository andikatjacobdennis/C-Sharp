# Enumeration types as bit flags

If you want an enumeration type to represent a combination of choices, define enum members for those choices such that an individual choice is a bit field. That is, the associated values of those enum members should be the powers of two. Then, you can use the bitwise logical operators | or & to combine choices or intersect combinations of choices, respectively. To indicate that an enumeration type declares bit fields, apply the Flags attribute to it. As the following example shows, you can also include some typical combinations in the definition of an enumeration type.

```csharp
[Flags]
public enum Days
{
    None      = 0b_0000_0000,  // 0
    Monday    = 0b_0000_0001,  // 1
    Tuesday   = 0b_0000_0010,  // 2
    Wednesday = 0b_0000_0100,  // 4
    Thursday  = 0b_0000_1000,  // 8
    Friday    = 0b_0001_0000,  // 16
    Saturday  = 0b_0010_0000,  // 32
    Sunday    = 0b_0100_0000,  // 64
    Weekend   = Saturday | Sunday
}

public class FlagsEnumExample
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Days meetingDays = Days.Monday | Days.Wednesday | Days.Friday;
        Console.WriteLine(meetingDays);
        // Output:
        // Monday, Wednesday, Friday

        Days workingFromHomeDays = Days.Thursday | Days.Friday;
        Console.WriteLine($"Join a meeting by phone on {meetingDays & workingFromHomeDays}");
        // Output:
        // Join a meeting by phone on Friday

        bool isMeetingOnTuesday = (meetingDays & Days.Tuesday) == Days.Tuesday;
        Console.WriteLine($"Is there a meeting on Tuesday: {isMeetingOnTuesday}");
        // Output:
        // Is there a meeting on Tuesday: False

        var a = (Days)37;
        Console.WriteLine(a);
        // Output:
        // Monday, Wednesday, Saturday
    }
}
```
