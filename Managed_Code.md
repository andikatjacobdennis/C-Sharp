# Managed Code

Code that you develop with a language compiler that targets the runtime is called managed code. 

Managed code benefits from features such as 

* cross-language integration
* cross-language exception handling, enhanced security
* versioning and deployment support
* a simplified model for component interaction
* debugging and profiling services.
