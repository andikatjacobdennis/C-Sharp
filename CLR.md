# CLR

.NET provides a run-time environment, called the common language runtime, that runs the code and provides services like

* **Cross language support**: The ability to easily use components developed in other languages.
* Support for structured **exception handling**.
* Extensible types provided by a **class library**.
* **Language features** such as inheritance, interfaces, and overloading **for object-oriented programming**.
* Support for **explicit free threading** that allows creation of multithreaded, scalable applications.
* Support for **custom attributes**.
* **Garbage collection**.
* Use of **delegates** instead of function pointers for increased type safety and security
