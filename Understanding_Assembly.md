# Understanding Assembly

In the .NET Framework, there are two types of assemblies. They are as follows:

* EXE (Executable)
* DLL (Dynamic Link Library)

# Exe vs DLL

* The EXE is run in its own address space or in its own memory space. If you double click on the MyConsoleApp EXE then you will get the following output
* The reason behind the DLL is reusability. Suppose you want some class, or logic, or something else in many applications, then simply put those classes, logic inside a DLL, and refer that DLL wherever it is required.
