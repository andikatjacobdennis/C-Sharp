# On a 32-bit machine:

* Any CPU: runs as a 32-bit process, can load Any CPU and x86 assemblies, will get BadImageFormatException if it tries to load an x64 assembly.

* x86: same as Any CPU.

* x64: BadImageFormatException always.

# On a 64-bit machine:

* Any CPU: runs as a 64-bit process, can load Any CPU and x64 assemblies, will get BadImageFormatException if it tries to load an x86 assembly.

* x86: runs as a 32-bit process, can load Any CPU and x86 assemblies, will get BadImageFormatException if it tries to load an x64 assembly.

* x64: same as Any CPU.

It is the JIT compiler that generates an assembly code that's compatible with the requested target based on this flag.
