# CLI

In late 90's Microsoft has started the development of .Net framework under the name 
of NGWS(Next Generation Window Systems) 

To develop the framework first they have prepared a set of specification for all the .net 
language known as CLI (Common language infrastructure) 

This CLI talks about 4 important things in it: 

* CLS (Common Language Specification) 
* CTS (Common Type System) 
* BCL (Base Class Library) 
* VSE or CLR(VirtuaI Execution System or Common Language Runtime)
