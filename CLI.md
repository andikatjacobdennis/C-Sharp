# CLI

In late 90's Microsoft has started the development of .Net framework under the name 
of NGWS(Next Generation Window Systems) 

To develop the framework first they have prepared a set of specification for all the .net 
language known as CLI (Common language infrastructure) 

This CLI talks about 4 important things in it: 

* **CLS** (Common Language Specification) 

  It is a set of base rules for all the .net languages to communicate with each other. 

  After compilation of any .net language they must generate the same output code. That 
  is CIL or MSIL code.

  Example: 
  
  VB.Net ----> VBC ----> CIL Code
  
  C#.Net ----> CSC ----> CIL Code

* **CTS** (Common Type System) 
* **BCL** (Base Class Library) 
* VSE or **CLR**(VirtuaI Execution System or Common Language Runtime)
